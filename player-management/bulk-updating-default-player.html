    <p>The curl statement shown in this document will loop over a number of accounts and update ONLY the
      <strong>Brightcove Default Player</strong> in those accounts to a desired Brightcove Player version. As a
      pre-requisite for the curl statement used to do the update and publish, it is shown how to get an access token to
      use in the curl statement.</p>

    <h2 id="section-name">Get access token</h2>
    <p>You need to have an access token that provides <strong>Player Read/Write</strong> access for all accounts on
      which you are going to use the curl statement. In Studio, from the <strong>Admin</strong> dropdown select
      <strong>API Authentication</strong>. Register a new application and select the desired accounts. For the
      <strong>Exposed Brightcove APIs</strong> choose <strong>Players &gt; Read/Write</strong> and <strong>CMS &gt;
        Videos &gt; Read/Write</strong>.</p>

        src="/assets/images/s-apis-general-img/player-management/api-authentication-ui.png" /></figure>
    <p>After you save, copy the <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong>.</p>
    <p>For more info on this process, see the <a
        href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-api-authentication-credentials.html">Generating
        Access Tokens</a> document.</p>
    <p>Now to get your access token, use the client ID and client secret with this sample: <a
        href="/oauth/code-samples/oauth-api-sample-get-access-token.html">OAuth API Sample: Get an Access Token</a>.
      Remember, you may have to use this sample repeatedly as access tokens are only valid for 5 minutes.</p>

    <h2 id="curl_statement">curl statement</h2>
    <p>Create a folder where you will create a couple of files and from where you will run a script from Terminal. In
      that folder create a file named <strong>accountList.txt</strong>, and in the file simply copy and paste all the
      <strong>account IDs</strong> for which you want to update the <strong>Brightcove Default Player</strong>.</p>
    <p>Now create another file named <strong>bulk-update.sh</strong>. Place the following curl statement in the file:
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-bash" translate="No">#!/bin/bash

#Loop through publisher IDs in accountlist.txt
while read -r ACCOUNTID; do
echo {account_id}ID

#Update
curl -X PATCH "https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{account_id}ID/players/default/configuration" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"player":{"template":{"version":"6.34.3"}}}'

#Publish
curl -X POST "https://players.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{account_id}ID/players/default/publish" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"comment": "Updated to v6"}'

#Wait 1 second then loop
sleep 1
done &lt;accountList.txt</code></pre>
    <p>Of course, you will need to replace the two instances of <strong>YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE</strong> with your actual
      access token. If it has been more than 5 minutes since your generated your access token, re-run the sample to get
      a new token. Also, you may use any version of the player, just update the version used, <strong>6.34.3</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>Lastly open a Terminal instance in the folder with the two files. To run the script enter:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-bash" translate="No">bash ./bulk-update.sh</code></pre>
    <p>The script both updates the player version, and publishes the player.</p>
