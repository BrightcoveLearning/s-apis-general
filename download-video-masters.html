    <p>Brightcove generally stores video masters to use in case you need to retranscode the video sometime in the future. You may need to download some or all of your video masters, perhaps because your original video files were accidentally deleted. Studio and the CMS API do not provide a direct way to do this, but because MRSS feeds created with the Social Syndication API can provide links to the video masters, you can use these feeds to download them.</p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    Be aware of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        There are cases where the video master will not be available:
        <ul>
          <li>All standard ingest profiles store the video master, but if you are using a custom ingest profile, it is possible that it specifies that masters should not be stored.</li>
          <li>It is possible using the CMS API to delete video masters, and some customers have opted to do that in order to reduce data storage costs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The video master may be the original video file that you ingested, or it may be a slightly modified copy: during the transcoding process, we inspect the video file and sometimes find minor encoding errors - in this case we correct the errors in a copy that we store as the video master.</li>
    </ul>

    <summary>New to working with APIs?</summary>
    <p>If you are new to working with APIs, and just doing this to retrieve your video masters, here is some information to help you. REST APIs are popular because to make the request, you just open a URL with the appropriate HTTP method. Browsers do this every time you open a web page, but they are only using the GET HTTP method. There are others.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, there are many tools out there to help you make REST API requests, and they are sufficient if you just need to make one or a few requests. We have documented how to use a couple of the most popular ones with the Brightcove APIs:</p>

    </ul>

    <p>Here are the high-level steps for setting up the feed to download your masters - the steps are detailed in the sections that follow.</p>

      <li>Obtain <a href="#Authentication">authentication credentials</a> for the Social Syndication API if you do not already have them.</li>
      <li><a href="#create_mrss_feed">Create an MRSS feed</a> of the "universal" type, that can accept a template</li>

    <p>Access to the Configuration API requires specification of a <code translate="No">bearer</code> token from the <a href="/oauth/getting-started/overview-oauth-api-v4.html">Brightcove OAuth service</a> in the request's <code translate="No">Authorization</code> header. The various API methods also require one of the following operations (depending upon the method accessed) to be specified for the credentials in question:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code translate="No">video-cloud/social/mrss/read</code></li>
      <li><code translate="No">video-cloud/social/mrss/write</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>These operations can be configured via the <a href="/general/managing-api-authentication-credentials.html">API Authentication section of the Studio Admin Module</a>:</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: the operations will <strong>not</strong> appear in Studio unless the account has the Social Module enabled. They can still be added using the OAuth API as explained below.</aside>

    <p>If you prefer, you can also create credentials via the OAuth API:</p>

      <li><a href="/oauth/guides/oauth-create-client-credentials-using-postman.html">Create Client Credentials Using Postman</a></li>
    </ul>
