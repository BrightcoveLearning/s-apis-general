    <p>Brightcove generally stores video masters to use in case you need to retranscode the video sometime in the future. You may need to download some or all of your video masters, perhaps because your original video files were accidentally deleted. Studio and the CMS API do not provide a direct way to do this, but because MRSS feeds created with the Social Syndication API can provide links to the video masters, you can use these feeds to download them.</p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    Be aware of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        There are cases where the video master will not be available:
        <ul>
          <li>All standard ingest profiles store the video master, but if you are using a custom ingest profile, it is possible that it specifies that masters should not be stored.</li>
          <li>It is possible using the CMS API to delete video masters, and some customers have opted to do that in order to reduce data storage costs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The video master may be the original video file that you ingested, or it may be a slightly modified copy: during the transcoding process, we inspect the video file and sometimes find minor encoding errors - in this case we correct the errors in a copy that we store as the video master.</li>
    </ul>
